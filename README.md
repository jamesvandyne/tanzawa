# Tanzawa

Tanzawa is a blogging system designed for the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) that focuses on sustainability.

# Running Tanzawa

The simplest way to run try Tanzawa is to run it locally in a Docker container.

Running Tanzawa outside of Docker requires the following:

* Python 3.9
* Spatalite (Geo-enabled SQLite) or Postgres with PostGIS enabled. We recommend Spatalite for most blogs.

Please refer to the [GeoDjango installation documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/) for setting up the appropriate environment.

## Prepare Docker Image
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jamesvandyne/tanzawa.git
$ cd tanzawa
$ docker image build . -t tanzawa
```

Prepare your .env file and generate a secure secret key and append it to your .env file 

```
$ cp .env.sample .env
$ python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())" | xargs -I{} -n1 echo SECRET_KEY={} >> .env
```

## First Run of Tanzawa
